Dear Reviewer 1,

Thank you for your review, it was helpful. 
We have fixed all issue, you pointed at and added a simple pictures describing different distillation orders.

About temperature values: we are assuming that there are some regenerative heat-exchanger (it is now added to Fig. 1) and its irreversibility is negligibly low, so we can also assume that all of external flows have the temperature of T_D (and, of course, T_F = T_D).
It slightly lowers the irreversibility estimate, but makes the system analysis simpler.
